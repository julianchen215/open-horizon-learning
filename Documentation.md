# Open Horizon Documentation
The purpose of this repository is to document my experience working on the Open Horizon project and what I have learned. Initially, I believed that Open Horizon was one
big project with a single repository; however, it turned out to be one community with multiple individual repositories that all had issues. Because of this style, there
was not much guidance or direction and I just picked from the plethora of repositories that had issues. Some of the issues within these repositories were extremely simple
and some were difficult and required more experience. My original plan was to start with the simple issues and then work my way up to the more difficult issues. Here
are the issues that I have accomplished so far.

## Adding Shields to README
These types of issues are the most common ones that I have seen across all of the repositories. They are all labeled "good first issue", which is the reason as to why I began working on these types of questions first.

I did not know what a shield was at first, but after watching this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl-ekLb4quE&t=274s) on how to add shields in Github, it was a relatively straightforward assignment.
